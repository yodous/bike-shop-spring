## About The Project

This is my first more extensive project build from scratch by myself. Main goal of this repo was to ground my knowledge about
Spring Boot, SQL and security. For now project is done with basic functionality and won't be developed for some time.
You will find GUI and demo upon 
this <a href="https://github.com/JFrred/eshop-frontend-angular"> link </a>.

### Built With

* [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/)
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
* [Junit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/)
* [Hibernate](https://hibernate.org/)
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
* [Jwt](https://jwt.io)
* [Apache Commons Lang3](https://commons.apache.org/)

## Quick start

### command line

This [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/) application is built
using [Maven](https://spring.io/guides/gs/maven/). You can build a jar file and run it from the command line (it should
work just as well with Java 8, 11).

  ```sh
git clone https://github.com/JFrred/bike-shop-spring.git
cd bike-shop-spring
./mvnw package
java -jar target/*.jar
  ```

### maven plugin

Or you can run it from Maven directly using the Spring Boot Maven plugin

  ```sh
./mvnw spring-boot:run
  ```

Then go to http://localhost:8080/

## Planned improvements

- [ ] implement [Facade pattern](https://www.sihui.io/design-pattern-facade/) for placing orders
- [ ] count user daily login
- [ ] total spent money by user
- [ ] add product to favorite
